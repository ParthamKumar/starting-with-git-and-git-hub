<P>This is the new file that we has added but the git is not tracking (Untracked) this file </P>
<p>Our git does not know that we have added the new file and modified it </p>
<p>It is because this new file was not the part of our original code </p>
<\<p>If we modify this the git will still show this as  Untracked not the modified because we never has commited this file to our git </p>
